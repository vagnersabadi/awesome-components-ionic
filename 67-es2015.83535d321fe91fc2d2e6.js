The tourism board hopes to bring back the waiver, and if you\u2019re planning to take advantage, save time to visit Angra dos Reis, between Rio and S\xe3o Paulo. This popular Brazilian vacation area is where cariocas go to escape the crowds. \u201cIt\u2019s where many of the country\u2019s elite have their beach villas,\u201d says Martin Frankenberg of Matuete, who has access to several of these glamorous rentals. Big changes are coming to the region. In May, Brazilian chain Fasano will open a long-awaited 54-suite hotel in a complex that includes a marina, golf course, restaurants, and a spa. The design is striking, with elevated wooden buildings that look like they\u2019re floating, all with open-air terraces and views of the forest and sea.

Stay at the design-forward Bullitt Hotel (inspired by the Steve McQueen film), which opened in October with casual, well-appointed rooms and complimentary grab-and-go breakfast granola. Check out arts organization Seedhead, which runs street-art tours and hosts pop-up cabarets around the city. The Michelin-starred OX and EIPIC lead the fine-dining pack, but also visit Permit Room, with its internationally inspired breakfast and locally roasted coffee. Noteworthy new nightlife spots include the Muddlers Club, a stylish restaurant and cocktail bar in the trendy Cathedral Quarter, and Vandal, a graffiti-adorned pizza place that turns into a late-night club, on the top floor of a 17th-century pub.\u2014Nell McShane Wulfhart",imageUrl:"http://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/964x524/public/1480711606/belfast-city-hall-northern-ireland-WTG2017.jpg?itok=mCqumH31"},{name:"Belgrade, Serbia",description:"Since the end of the Yugoslav wars, Belgrade has attracted steady investment\u2014its graffiti-covered neighborhoods are now full of restaurants and bars.

The promise of a flood of wealthy visitors\u2014and a loosening of restrictions on foreign investment\u2014has sparked a spate of development. Big news is the $100 million overhaul of the Hamilton Princess & Beach Club, the island\u2019s 132-year-old grande dame, whose revamped rooms have a fresh, contemporary look.
